# RoomBookingSystem - Source Package

This package contains a starter ASP.NET Core 8 MVC application for room & boardroom bookings using SQL Server and SMTP email.

## Quick start

1. Edit `appsettings.json` and set your SQL Server connection string and SMTP settings.
2. From the project root (where RoomBookingSystem.csproj is), run:
   ```bash
   dotnet restore
   dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate
   dotnet ef database update
   dotnet run
   ```
3. Visit https://localhost:5001 (or the port shown). Seeded accounts:
   - admin@local.com / Admin@12345 (Admin role)
   - user@local.com / User@12345 (User role)

## Notes

- Recurring bookings are generated by a background worker (every 15 minutes it will create upcoming instances).
- Bookings are stored as UTC. The web forms show/collect local times; the sample code stores UTC conversions.
- Emails are sent using SMTP via `SmtpEmailSender`. Configure in `appsettings.json`.

If you want, I can also add full views for booking creation/editing and the admin UI in a follow-up zip.
